# MagicJSON #
Easy handling of JSON serialization and deserialization for python objects.

If you are just interested in making basic serialization easier you might
want to look [here](https://github.com/DavidCEllis/magicjson/blob/main/plain_serializer/jsonregister.py).

I thought this would use magic __ methods but decorators were more flexible
and now this might need a better name.
